The directory is a self-contained R project.  To run it, R should be started in
an interactive session (so that the file .Rprofile is loaded) and the file
start_script.R should be executed, using

  source('start_script.r')

It is also possible to run the code from the RStudio IDE, available at
https://rstudio.com/
